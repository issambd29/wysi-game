Create a playable 2D nature-themed arcade game called “Earth Keeper.”
The game should feel alive, meaningful, and environmental.

🌱 PLAYER & ROLE

The player is Earth Keeper — a guardian chosen by nature.

The player controls a nature-powered guardian at the bottom of the screen
(eco-drone, forest spirit, or green energy vessel).

The guardian moves left and right smoothly.

The guardian automatically releases continuous eco-energy shots upward
(cleaning beams, seeds, water pulses, or green light).

The player does not press a fire button — nature acts continuously.

☔ GARBAGE RAIN (CORE THREAT)

From the sky, pollution rains down constantly, like a storm against nature.

Falling objects are ONLY environmental waste:

Plastic bottles and bags

Metal cans and scraps

Electronic waste

Toxic barrels

Oil drops

This should feel like a “pollution rain” — relentless and increasing over time.

🌍 INTERACTION & GOAL

Eco-shots clean/destroy garbage on contact

Cleaned garbage:

Increases Score

Slightly restores Nature Health

Garbage that reaches the ground:

Damages Nature Health

Toxic garbage:

Causes heavier damage

🎯 Goal:
Survive as long as possible and keep Nature Health alive.

❌ Failure:
When Nature Health reaches zero, the land is lost.

🧰 TOOLS & POWER-UPS (NATURE GIFTS)

Nature occasionally helps the player with tools:

🌿 Shield of Leaves – temporary protection

💧 Water Surge – stronger or wider cleaning shots

⏳ Time Bloom – slows falling garbage

🌱 Seed Burst – clears multiple garbage objects at once

Power-ups appear naturally, glowing softly.

📊 HUD & FEEDBACK

Always visible, styled with organic UI:

🌱 Nature Health Bar

⭐ Score

⏱️ Time Survived

🔼 Level / Intensity

Visual feedback:

Screen subtly darkens when nature is hurt

Brighter greens and light when nature recovers

📈 PROGRESSION & DIFFICULTY

As time passes:

Garbage falls faster

More garbage appears at once

Toxic waste becomes more frequent

The storm feels heavier and more urgent

The game should pressure the player emotionally, not just mechanically.

🎨 ATMOSPHERE & STYLE

Backgrounds: forests, fields, rivers, sky

Colors: greens, blues, earth tones

Motion: leaves drifting, light rays, soft wind feeling

Mood: calm but urgent, hopeful but fragile

💬 CORE MESSAGE (SUBTLE, NOT PREACHY)

The game should quietly communicate:

“Nature does not fight back.
It waits for someone to protect it.”
