Design a creative, immersive, nature-themed game gateway website using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
The website must feel like a living natural world, not a traditional webpage — as if the player is entering nature itself.

The game title is Earth Keeper.

🌱 CORE CONCEPT

The player is a guardian of nature.
Before entering the game world, they arrive at a calm, cinematic gateway where they:

See the world

Read the story

View controls

Have a player profile stored in Firebase Realtime Database

The experience should feel peaceful, meaningful, and alive.

🎨 VISUAL IDENTITY – LIVING NATURE (ENHANCED)
Inspiration

Forests breathing with light

Wind flowing through leaves

Sun rays breaking through trees

Earth, balance, life, and harmony

Color System

Primary: Deep forest green

Secondary: Moss green, olive, soft bark brown

Accent: Warm sunlight gold

Highlights: Sky mist blue

Visual Language

Layered gradients (organic, soft)

Subtle fog, light rays, floating pollen particles

Soft blur and glow effects

Rounded, organic shapes (NO sharp edges)

Depth illusion using overlays and gradient masks

Everything should feel natural, calm, and sacred.
