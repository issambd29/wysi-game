Create a fully playable browser-based 2D arcade game titled “Earth Keeper”, designed to be embedded inside an existing nature-themed website.

This must be a real, functional game with actual gameplay, logic, and progression — not a mockup.

🎯 CORE GAME CONCEPT

The player is a Guardian of Nature.

Pollution is falling from the sky and threatening forests, rivers, and the land.
The player must clean the pollution continuously to protect the environment.

Win condition: Survive and keep Nature Health above zero.
Lose condition: Nature Health reaches zero.

Core message:

Nature survives only if it is protected.
